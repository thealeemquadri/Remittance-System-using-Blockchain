Flash is aBlockchain blockchain based remittance system which can be used for cross-border money transaction.

The system is built on Multichain and Django.

Every transaction in the system is stored in an immutable block of the system blockchain. 

The email id of the user is linked with his wallet address in the blockchain.

While transferring the money, wallet address of both the sender and user is required. 

Linking of email id with wallet address makes the identification of wallet addresses easy. 

Every transaction is authenticated by a miner in the blockchain.

Blockchain proved to be more secure and time efficient as compared to existing systems
